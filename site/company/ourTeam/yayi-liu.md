name: Simon Leung
title: UX/UI Designer
bio: Simon is a UX/UI designer who values highly in connecting people closer to
  products or services seamlessly with validated research, data-driven, and
  iterative design solutions. At every stage of the design process, he enforced
  best Ux practices, web accessibility standards, and consistent design
  patterns. Design is always designing for humans in mind and never just for
  pure aesthetics.  Problems should be seen as opportunities to improve and
  iterate on a better solution. Creating a great product is also a team sport,
  so he values collaborating with team members and stakeholders to achieve
  alignment.
