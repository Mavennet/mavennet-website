    description:
      "Information exchange in the oil industry today is largely manual,
      with redundancies in regulatory reporting. Analysis of origins and
      traceability of flows is susceptible to errors, miscommunication and
      misrepresentation. The standard today is for each participant in the value
      chain independently maintaining status information siloed in multiple
      systems, exchanging information through point to point communications,
      resulting in a complete lack of an end to end view. "
