    description: Millions of dollars are lost every year, not due to logistical
      problems, but rather due to the inability share digital data in a reliable
      way. Costs of audit, tariff overpayments, lack of real-time visibility of
      assets and superfluous back office costs represent north of 1 billion for
      the Canadian oil industry every year. While many companies have gone
      through massive digital transformations the reality is that when
      information is shared with other organizations companies go back to the
      old traditional paper flow, since there is yet a secure industry standard
      to exchange data.

    description: The overproduction of steel at global level is putting a huge
      strain on north American production. Counterfeit, potential transshipment,
      lack of real-time information and an unstable regulatory framework results
      in the reduction of the competitivity of local industries. A single source
      of truth, automatic fraud detection through AI and the ability to prove
      origination and provenance of products in real-time is expected to become
      a must across the industry.

    description: The financial services industry is getting disrupted by the digital
      transformation of processes and assets. Now more than ever it is paramount
      for enterprises to gain access to streamlined settlement, decentralized
      exchange platforms and secure data. These have the power to unlocking the
      value of digital assets, faster audits and instant payments.
